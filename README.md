## 🎮 Rules of Blackjack

1. The goal is to get **as close to 21** as possible **without going over**.
2. Number cards count as their number.
3. Face cards (J, Q, K) count as **10**.
4. Aces (A) can count as **1 or 11**, depending on which is more beneficial.
5. The dealer has one hidden card until the player clicks **"Stay"**.
6. The dealer **must hit until their total is 17 or more**.
7. Player wins if:
   - Their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer’s.
   - The dealer **busts** (goes over 21) and the player doesn’t.
8. **Push** (tie) occurs if both player and dealer have equal hands.
